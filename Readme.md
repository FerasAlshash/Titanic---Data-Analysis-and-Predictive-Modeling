# Titanic Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling  

## 🛳️ Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset to uncover insights about passenger survival and build a machine learning model to predict survival probabilities.  

The analysis explores questions such as:  
- Does age affect survival chances?  
- Does gender play a role in survival?  
- How does ticket price or class impact survival rates?  

## 🚀 Key Features  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Visualization of key features like age, gender, ticket class, and survival.  
   - Insights into relationships between these features and survival outcomes.  

2. **Predictive Modeling**:  
   - Machine learning model built using Python to predict passenger survival.  
   - Performance evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle and contains information about Titanic passengers, including demographics, ticket details, and survival status.  

## 📂 Project Structure  
- **Titanic_Data_Analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis and modeling process.  
- **data/**: Folder containing the Titanic dataset.  
- **images/**: Visualizations and charts generated during the analysis.  

## 🌟 Insights and Results  
- Significant factors affecting survival include passenger class, gender, and age.
